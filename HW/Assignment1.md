## Difference between a Library and Framework?
The term Library and Framework are often used interchangeably in programming, but they have distinct differences.

### 1. Definition
  - Library: A library is a collection of pre-written code, functions, classes, and routines that you can use to perform common tasks. It provides specific functionality that you can call and use as needed, but you maintain full control over the flow of your application.

  - Framework: A framework is a more extensive, larger collection of code that provides a foundation for building software applications. It dictates the structure and flow of your application and often enforces rules on how you should organize your code. In a framework, the control flow is typically inverted, meaning the framework call your code, not the other way around.

### 2. Examples

  - Library Examples:
    - jQuery: A JavaScript library for DOM manipulation.
    - Lodash: A utility library for JavaScript that simplifies common programming tasks (e.g., manipulating arrays, objects, etc.).
    - NumPy: A Python library for scientific computing that provides support for large arrays and matrices.

  - Framework Examples:
    - React: A JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It dictates how your components should be structured and how state and rendering should work.
    - Django: A Python framework for building web applications that provides an ORM, templates, and a robust way to manage web projects.
    - Angular: A framework for building single-page web applications that provides tools like routing, dependency injection, and state management.


##  What is CDN? Why do we use it?
A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a system of geographically distributed servers designed to deliver content (such as web pages, images, videos, JavaScript, stylsheets, etc.) to users based on their geographical location. The primary goal of a CDN is to speed up the delivery of content by reducing latency and minimizing the distance between the user and the server hosting the content.

A CDN typically works by replicating content across multiple servers located in different regions or data centers around the world. When a user requests content, the CDN will route that request to the closest available server, thereby reducing the time it take for the content to reach the user.

CDNs offer several benefits, especially for websites and applications that serve large amounts of content or have global audiences. Here are the key reasons to use a CDN:
1. Improved Performance and Speed
2. Scalability
3. Reduced Bandwidth Costs
4. Improved Avaliability and Reliability 
5. Security Benefits
6. SEO Benefits
7. Global Reach
